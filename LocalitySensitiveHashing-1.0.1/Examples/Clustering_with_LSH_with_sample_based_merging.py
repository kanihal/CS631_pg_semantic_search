##  Clustering_with_LSH_with_sample_based_merging.py

##  The script demonstrates clustering using the neighbors produced by the basic 
##  LSH algorithm.  The neighborhoods are first coalesced on the basis of shared
##  data samples (which, in general, as I have mentioned elsewhere, is NOT a safe 
##  thing to do with the output of the LSH algorithm).  Subsequently, if the number
##  of clusters thus created (also referred to as 'similarity groups' in this
##  module) exceeds the expected number specified in the call to the module 
##  constructor, the module pools together the samples in the smallest of the 
##  clusters that are in excess.  Each sample in the pool is then assigned to the
##  retained clusters on the basis of closeness of the distance between the sample
##  and the cluster means.

##  Call syntax:
